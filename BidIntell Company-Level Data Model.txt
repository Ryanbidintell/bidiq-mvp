BidIntell Company-Level Data Model

What to Track, Why, and How It Compounds

Guiding Rules (Non-Negotiable)

Track what changes decisions, not what looks impressive

Prefer ranges, categories, and signals over exact numbers

Everything must age well (time-series friendly)

Nothing should ever feel like surveillance

TIER 1 — REQUIRED COMPANY CONTEXT

(Collected once, lightly editable)

This is the minimum identity + operating context needed for scoring and aggregation.

1. Company Identity

What

Company name (normalized)

Primary office location (city, state)

Service metros / regions

Why

Location scoring

Market aggregation

Trade × metro intelligence

Sensitivity

Low

2. Trades Performed (CSI Divisions)

What

Primary trade(s)

Secondary trade(s) (optional)

Why

Trade Match scoring

Capacity aggregation

Market pressure indices

Sensitivity

Low

3. Company Size (Bucketed)

What (choose one)

1–10 employees

11–25

26–50

51–100

100+

Why

Context for win rates

Competition modeling

Capacity inference without asking payroll

Sensitivity

Medium (but safe when bucketed)

4. Typical Project Size (Range)

What

<$250k

$250k–$1M

$1M–$5M

$5M–$20M

$20M+

Why

Fit scoring

Competition realism

BidIndex calibration

Sensitivity

Medium

5. Risk Tolerance (Already in product)

What

Low / Medium / High

Why

Contract risk penalties

Clause interpretation

Explains override behavior

Sensitivity

Low

TIER 2 — DECISION CONTEXT (CRITICAL)

(Captured gradually through usage)

This is where BidIntell becomes defensible.

6. Capacity Posture (State, Not Numbers)

What

Hungry / Steady / Maxed

Captured

At onboarding

Monthly pulse

Implicitly via declines (“capacity constraints”)

Why

Recommendation context

Capacity Pressure Index

Explains bid behavior shifts

Sensitivity

Medium
Mitigation

Never exposed individually

Aggregated only

7. Service Radius Behavior (Observed, Not Declared)

What

How far they actually bid vs stated radius

Why

Location Fit calibration

Market expansion detection

Competitive behavior insight

Sensitivity

Low
Key Insight

Observed behavior > stated preferences

8. Competition Sensitivity

What

Win rate vs GC count

Decline likelihood vs competition

Why

Bid Market Index

Personalized competition penalties

Market participation forecasting

Sensitivity

Low

TIER 3 — PERFORMANCE & OUTCOME SIGNALS

(Captured passively, weighted by confidence)

This is where your intelligence layers gain credibility.

9. Outcome History (Structured)

What

Win / Loss / Ghost

Decision confidence (1–5)

Time-to-outcome

Why

GC behavior intelligence

Bid Market Index

Algorithm refinement

Sensitivity

Medium
Mitigation

Personal by default

Aggregated only at scale

10. Margin Bands (Optional, Delayed)

What

Margin range buckets (e.g. <10%, 10–20%, 20%+)

Why

Personal ROI intelligence

Market stress detection

Future premium insights

Sensitivity

High
Rule

Do not require this early

Only ask after trust is established

TIER 4 — CAPACITY & WORKLOAD INTELLIGENCE

(Opt-in, monthly, lightweight)

This feeds the Capacity Pressure Index.

11. Workload Pulse (Monthly)

What

Current workload status

Trades impacted

Optional crew range

Confidence (1–5)

Why

Market capacity modeling

Forward-looking risk signals

Explains bid scarcity

Sensitivity

High
Mitigation

Opt-in

Aggregated

Lagged

Minimum sample enforced

TIER 5 — TRUST & CORRECTION SIGNALS

(This is rare and extremely valuable)

12. Agreement / Override Behavior

What

Agree / Score too high / Score too low

Optional explanation

Why

Detect false positives/negatives

Train scoring logic

Identify systemic bias

Sensitivity

Low
Value

This is one of your strongest proprietary signals

13. Confidence Discipline

What

Confidence score attached to:

Outcomes

Capacity updates

Major corrections

Why

Weight data quality

Prevent garbage aggregation

Protect market intelligence credibility

Sensitivity

Low

What You Should NOT Track (Ever)

These kill trust and are unnecessary:

❌ Revenue
❌ Payroll
❌ Exact backlog dollars
❌ Customer names
❌ Individual crew assignments
❌ Pricing formulas

If you need them, you’ve designed the wrong system.

How This All Compounds (Big Picture)
Data Type	Enables
Company context	Accurate personalization
Decisions + overrides	Explainable intelligence
Outcomes + confidence	Behavioral truth
Capacity posture	Market pressure modeling
Aggregation	Bid Market Index
Time series	Predictive power
Trust	$100M outcome
The One Design Rule to Enforce Everywhere

Ask for the least sensitive version of the signal that still changes a decision.

You’ve already done this instinctively — this framework just formalizes it.
